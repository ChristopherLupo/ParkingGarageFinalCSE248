# ParkingGarageFinalCSE248

The garage is made of a garage part and account maker section.

The account section is a binary tree that can add as many accounts as needed

The garage section has three arraysLists that can hold ten vehichle items each
One is for cars, another is for motorcycles and te last one is for trucks.

I thought the account section who take me about an hour to right, but it took me about three becasue I had a hard time save and loading the user data to a file.

I thought the garage would take me about 5 hours becasue of the diffenent vehicle types. It look me about 6, that is also because the save information to file.

The main was origionally planed to only take about an hour, but took me about five. The reason is becasuse of the of the problems I had making user the android UI.

The vehicle abstract class took me about 20 minutes to write and the 3 subclasses took about 5 minutes each.

The only issue is that the add truck and add motorcycle buttons don't work
